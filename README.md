# Klasifikasi Dataset Wine Menggunakan Algoritma K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Objective:
This project aims to classify wine samples into three distinct categories using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The dataset contains information about wine samples with chemical attributes that help distinguish between the three classes. The project focuses on finding the optimal value of K for the KNN algorithm by evaluating its performance using cross-validation.

Key Features:
1. Find the K value that gives the highest accuracy.
2. Standardize the dataset using StandardScaler to improve model performance.
3. Evaluate the model using K-Fold Cross Validation (k=5) for robust accuracy estimation.
4. Analyze the model's performance with metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Visualize the error rate versus K values to understand the relationship between K and model performance.

Goals:
1. Identify the optimal number of neighbors (K) to maximize classification accuracy.
2. Provide detailed performance evaluation using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
3. Highlight the importance of standardization and cross-validation in KNN.
4. Visualize the relationship between error rate and K values using cross-validation results.

Results:
1. Optimal K: Determined by testing multiple values of K using cross-validation and selecting the one with the highest accuracy.
2. Performance Metrics: Confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score indicate how well the model performs in predicting each wine class.
3. Error Rate vs. K Values: A visualization demonstrating how the error rate changes with different values of K, offering insights into model performance and stability.

Conclusion:
The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm effectively classified wine samples into three categories with high accuracy. By leveraging cross-validation, the optimal value of K was determined, and the model's performance was evaluated using comprehensive metrics. The results emphasize the importance of parameter tuning, standardization, and robust evaluation techniques in building a reliable classification model.
